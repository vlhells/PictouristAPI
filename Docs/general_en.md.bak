During the absence of the frontend, the attributes [Authorize] and [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] are commented out in the code.  
This decision was made due to the absence, according to the author of the project, of the need to reinvent the wheel:
In a full-fledged site (but this is only a backend), the attributes will work.  
  
There are also commented parts of the code in the Pictures controller. This is due to the considered (and so far postponed for an unknown period) possibility
to check the uniqueness of the pictures - and, in the case of finding the same (in content, not in name) - simply give access to the same picture  
multiple users. However, the opportunity is not considered necessary yet.  

The rest of the comments are also purposefully left in the code (at least for the most part :)).
